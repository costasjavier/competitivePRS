Title: Significance of Polygenic Risck Score of a SNPs Set Compared to Genomic Background
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Javier Costas
Maintainer: Javier Costas <javier.costas.costas@sergas.es>
Description: A package for estimation of the effect of a Polygenic Risk Score based on a SNP set
    in complex traits in comparison to a random set of SNPs matching the orginal set for several 
    properties, such as minor allele frequency, linkage disequilibrium, gene density and distance
    to nearest gene, based on the 1000 genomes European population, taking data from SNPsnap. In 
    addition, the SNPs also meet the P.threshold criterium based on the GWAS discovery samples.
