Title: Significance of Polygenic Risk Score of a SNP Set Compared to Genomic Background
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Javier Costas
Maintainer: Javier Costas <javier.costas.costas@sergas.es>
Description: A package for the estimation of Polygenic Risk Score of a SNP set, and calculation 
    of its significance, in a target case-control study based on comparison of the Nagelkerke's
    pseudo-R^2^ of the actual SNP set to random permutations of SNP sets matching the actual SNP
    set by a series of properties such as linkage disequilibrium pattern, minor allele frequency,
    distance to transcription start sites, and gene density.
