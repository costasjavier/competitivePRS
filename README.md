# competitivePRS
A package for estimation of the effect of a Polygenic Risk Score based on a SNP set
in complex traits in comparison to a random set of SNPs matching the orginal set for several 
properties, such as minor allele frequency, linkage disequilibrium, gene density and distance
to nearest gene, based on the 1000 genomes European population, taking data from SNPsnap. In 
addition, the SNPs also meet the P.threshold criterium based on the GWAS discovery samples.
