# competitivePRS
A package for the estimation of Polygenic Risk Score
of a SNP set, and calculation of its significance, in a target case-control study based on
comparison of the Nagelkerke's pseudo-R<sup>2</sup> of the actual SNP set to random permutations
of SNP sets matching the actual SNP set by a series of properties such as linkage disequilibrium pattern, minor allele frequency, distance to transcription start sites, and gene density.
